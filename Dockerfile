# --ignore-scripts is load-bearing. better-sqlite3 ships prebuilt binaries for
# linux/darwin/win x64+arm64 inside its tarball and declares no install script,
# but npm runs `node-gyp rebuild` by default for any package carrying a
# binding.gyp — which needs python3 and a C++ toolchain, and would compile from
# source what is already there. Nothing else in this tree needs an install
# script; if that changes, this flag has to be revisited.
